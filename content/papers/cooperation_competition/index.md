##### Abstract

Synchronization between limit cycle oscillators can arise through entrainment to an external drive or through mutual coupling. The interplay between the two mechanisms has been studied in classical synchronizing systems, but not in quantum systems. Here, we point out that competition and cooperation between the two mechanisms can occur due to phase pulling and phase repulsion in quantum systems. We study their interplay in collectively driven degenerate quantum thermal machines and show that these mechanisms either cooperate or compete depending on the working mode of the machine (refrigerator or engine). The entrainment-mutual synchronization interplay persists with an increase in the number of degenerate levels, while in the thermodynamic limit of degeneracy, mutual synchronization dominates. Overall, our work investigates the effect of degeneracy and multilevel scaling of quantum synchronization and shows how different synchronizing mechanisms can cooperate and compete in quantum systems.
