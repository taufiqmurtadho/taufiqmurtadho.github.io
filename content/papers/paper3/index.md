##### Abstract

Interference upon free expansion gives access to the relative phase between two interfering matter waves. Such measurements can be used to reconstruct the spatially-resolved relative phase, which is a key observable in many quantum simulations of quantum field theory and non-equilibrium experiments. However, in 1D systems, longitudinal dynamics is typically ignored in the analysis of experimental data. In our work, we give a detailed account of various effects and corrections that occur in finite temperatures due to longitudinal expansion. We provide an analytical formula showing a correction to the readout of the relative phase due to longitudinal expansion and mixing with the common phase. Furthermore, we numerically assess the error propagation to the estimation of the gases' physical quantities such as correlation functions and temperature. We also incorporate systematic errors arising from experimental imaging devices. Our work characterizes the reliability and robustness of interferometric measurements, directing us to the improvement of existing phase extraction methods necessary to observe new physical phenomena in cold-atomic quantum simulators.
