summary: "The second law of thermodynamics says that a system tend to increase its entropy. Yet, we observe synchronization phenomena where multiple oscillators adjust their rhythm and oscillate in harmony. How do we resolve these two facts?"

##### Abstract

Synchronization is a phenomenon where coupled limit-cycle oscillators develop
stable phase relations. In classical physics, synchronization has been used to
control artificial systems and enhance the performance of thermal machines.
Recently, the notion of synchronization has also been extended in the quantum
realm. However, most of the studies in quantum synchronization focus on
how to characterize and quantify synchronization in the quantum regime. Relatively
little research is done on applying quantum synchronization to quantum
devices. One of the earlier works [Phys. Rev. E 101, 020201(R)] in this direction
have shown that synchronization measure bounds the steady-state power
of a three-level maser heat engine. In this thesis, we investigated the effect of
synchronization on a multi-level generalization of such maser in the presence of
near-degeneracy and quantum interference. We showed that near-degeneracy and
quantum interference give rise to two co-existing synchronization mechanisms influencing
the system: entrainment and mutual coupling. We further observed
that the interplay between entrainment and mutual coupling is determined by
the thermodynamic functionality of the system. Specifically, they compete when
the system operates as an engine and cooperate when the system operates as a
refrigerator. Their competition in the engine regime causes the bound between
synchronization and steady-state power to be violated. We also formulated a
novel bound valid deep in the mutual coupling regime connecting synchronization
measure with steady-state heat current. These results demonstrate an intimate
relationship between quantum synchronization and quantum thermodynamics,
in line with the paradigm of synchronization as a collective phase of matter away
from equilibrium.
