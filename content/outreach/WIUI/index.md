Science does not happen in a vacuum; it happens within a societal context, and therefore science and sociopolitical issues can not be separated from each other. 

In 2021, I joined as one of the first volunteers in **What Is Up, Indonesia (WIUI)**,  an online media aimed to inspire and educate Indonesian youths about sociopolitical issues.

WIUI is now one of the major online educational media about Indonesian sociopolitics with 440,000+ followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whatisupindonesia/) and almost 50,000 subscribers on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@WIUI).
