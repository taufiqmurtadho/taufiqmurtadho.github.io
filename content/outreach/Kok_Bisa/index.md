[Kok Bisa](https://www.youtube.com/@KokBisa) is one of the biggest online educational media in Indonesia with a mission to provoke teen minds to stay curious and raise more questions, particularly in the areas of science and general knowledge. Its Youtube channel has 6 million+ subscribers. 

I am freelancing for Kok Bisa as a video script and content writer.
